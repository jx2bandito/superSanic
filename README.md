# Super Sanic Hegebros<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a small animation clip I made using GSAP and SVGs. I believe this was around the time
when I was also learning SCSS. I didn't take advantage of all of SCSS features, but I used those that I felt were 
relevant for this particular project.
