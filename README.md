# Super Sanic Hegebros<br />


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a small animation clip I made using GSAP and SVGs. I believe this was around the time
when I was also learning SCSS. I didn't take advantage of all of SCSS features, but I used those that I felt were 
relevant for this particular project. If you look at the styling, you might see some very insane percentage values for left and top. I was working with a short-lived experimental function I had made that allowed a person to drag an absolutely-positioned element around while showing its left and top values in percentages.
